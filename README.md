# Challenge-01 Code Refactoring
This is the first challenge of my coding bootcamp.

## Description
Starter code for the Horiseon website was provided for me and I was tasked with refactoring the HTML and CSS. The goal was to make the code cleaner and to make sure all of the websites functions were working properly.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
